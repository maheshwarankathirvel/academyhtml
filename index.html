 <h2>TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE</h2>
 <p>School is important because it is a tool to help prepare us for life.  Not only can we learn the basic skills to read, write, and do arithmetic but we can learn about peoples, places, and nature.  School prepares us to be the future caretakers of this planet when our parents are dead and gone, and it gives us the knowledge to pass on to our children and the future generation.  As such, we should appreciate the great gift we have when we're able to attend school.School is important because it teaches us about the world around us and prepares us with the tools we will need for future success in the job market. Outside of the classroom, students also learn valuable lessons at school, such as social skills, behavior, work ethic, working for people they don't like, and gaining a sense of personal achievement.</p>
